//NEED

//- Delta Compaction for old deltas
//-


//// Metrics
//Gossip Based
//- Gossip round duration, data transferred, deltas exchanged, and resolved conflicts.

// Application Extensibility

- For users to deploy the cluster to their use cases they would need:
    - Abstraction layer and interfaces to defines their own deltas
    - Key Registry??
    - Handler Registry for delta changes to check against registered handlers for what they should do (write to file etc)
    - Client Connections need to have commands to send data in for deltas to be made/updated


FUTURE SCOPE:

- dynamic handlers included in the gossip at runtime
- dynamic key registry included in the gossip



// Use Cases
