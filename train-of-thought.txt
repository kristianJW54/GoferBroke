For the gossip ticker - we need to have this adaptive to network load and node count

Need to go through the entire gossip flow and check that we are not holding onto references longer than needed to
free up for the gc as quickly as possible

=== Need to maybe have a server process ref counter or checker to make sure we are not leaking pool requests or buffers or ids etc

=== Need to have an error collecting processing for in-flight and on wire processes which collects, sends and handles errors based on a handling strategy
===== using the handle error callback handlers??

TODO

Node connection garbage collection - dead node cleaning
Bit compression for delta messages
Client connection routing - reach out to seed - seed decides best node to connect to - client then dials that and maybe keeps seed as fallback?


////

Need a node update rate which each node shares
A server will then have the update rate of all nodes and can determine gossip interval

Log the time of phi-accrual detecting dead node and use the timestamp to flag to a background process if it can clean the connection or not
