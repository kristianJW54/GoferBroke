For the gossip ticker - we need to have this adaptive to network load and node count

Need to go through the entire gossip flow and check that we are not holding onto references longer than needed to
free up for the gc as quickly as possible

=== Need to maybe have a server process ref counter or checker to make sure we are not leaking pool requests or buffers or ids etc
