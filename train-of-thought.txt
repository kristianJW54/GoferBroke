For the gossip ticker - we need to have this adaptive to network load and node count

/////////////////

TODO

Client connection routing - reach out to seed - seed decides best node to connect to - client then dials that and maybe keeps seed as fallback?


////

Need a node update rate which each node shares
A server will then have the update rate of all nodes and can determine gossip interval

Log the time of phi-accrual detecting dead node and use the timestamp to flag to a background process if it can clean the connection or not

///

For application clients who run gossip as side car cli
we need to have a client handshake which starts a node as an application client and maybe a handshake to confirm
this will enable us to have a 1:1 client node usage so the client application can act as a first class node
