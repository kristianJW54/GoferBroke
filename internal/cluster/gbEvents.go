Event Strategy â€” Reviewed

There are two types of events in the system: **Internal** and **External**

---

ðŸ”¹ Internal Events

Internal events are **system-level events** used to monitor or react to internal mechanics of the gossip protocol. These events are:
- **Pre-registered** by the system
- **Handled by the core** (not user-defined logic)
- Used to track or enforce protocol behavior
- Triggered only by **internal deltas** or system operations

These events are **strictly read-only for the server's self state**. That means:
- Even if a peer gossips an internal delta about "you", the server will not merge that value into its **own** state
- Instead, it will trigger an internal event for observation or failure detection

Example:
`InternalDeltaUpdated` â€” triggered when a node receives a newer version of an internal delta (e.g., number of connections) about a peer.

**Why this matters:**
> Internal deltas must never overwrite or influence the serverâ€™s self-state, even if other nodes gossip conflicting information.

---

ðŸ”¸ External Events

External events are triggered by **user-defined or application-level deltas** and changes in the system. These events:
- Can be **reacted to freely** by application developers
- May lead to updates in the serverâ€™s own state, if the application chooses
- Are **loosely coupled** to the protocol â€” acting on them does not affect core correctness

These events give **application designers flexibility** to use the gossip system as a state dissemination mechanism.

Example:
`UserDeltaReceived` â€” triggered when a node receives a new delta about a "to-do list" key from another peer.

> Application logic may choose to incorporate the peerâ€™s state into its own (e.g., merging tasks), but this is optional and application-specific.

---

ðŸ›‘ Warning on Merging External State

While external deltas **can** be merged into the serverâ€™s self state, it is **not recommended by default**. This blurs the ownership model and can lead to:
- Diverging update responsibilities
- Unclear authority over data

Applications must make **explicit decisions** when choosing to mirror peer state.

---

The event system provides a simple, reactive way to surface whatâ€™s happening inside the cluster.
It gives users visibility into key changes and lets them hook into events for things like logging, metrics, dashboards, or forwarding to external tools (e.g., HTTP tracing endpoints).
Itâ€™s designed to stay out of the core gossip logic while offering enough flexibility for users to monitor and respond to state changes as needed.
